# DRAFT Operating Agreement - Limeleaf Worker Cooperative, LLC

This Operating Agreement is entered into and made effective the __ day of  _____, 2024, by and among Blain Smith and John Luther (collectively referred to in this agreement as the "Founding Members").

# 1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The Company shall be organized and shall conduct its business primarily for the mutual benefit of its Members and the community. The earnings, savings, or benefits of the Company shall be used for the general welfare of the Members and the community, or it shall be proportionately and equitably distributed to its Members.

The Company is democratically controlled and is not organized to make a profit for itself, as such, but primarily for its Members. Its initial scope of operations will be the development of creative technology and all activities related thereto, but the Members may authorize a different or additional scope of operations.

# 2 FORMATION OF COMPANY

The Company has been organized as a New York member-managed limited liability company by the filing of the Articles of Organization with the New York Secretary of State.

## 2.1 NAME

The name of the Company is "Limeleaf Worker Cooperative LLC". All Company business shall be conducted under that name or abbreviated to “Limeleaf” or such other names that comply with applicable law as the Members may select from time to time.

## 2.2 TERM

The Company shall commence on the date the Articles are filed and shall continue until dissolved pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Act.

## 2.3 OFFICE

The Company will maintain its principal business office within the State of New York with the following initial mailing address: P.O. Box xxx, Schuylerville, NY, 12871

## 2.4 REGISTERED AGENT

??? is the Company's initial registered agent in the State of New York, and the registered office is ???.

# 3 MEMBERS

## 3.1 CLASSIFICATION OF MEMBERS

The Company shall have one (1) class of Member, called simply a "Member". A Member has one (1) vote in all voting decisions. The Company shall have no more than ten (10) Members.

## 3.2 MEMBERSHIP QUALIFICATIONS

A natural person may become a Member of this Company by:

- Working twelve (12) months for the Company (the "Candidacy Period");
- Being voted in, as set forth in Section 3.3, by the existing Members following the Candidacy Period; and
- Receiving a copy of the Company’s Articles of Organization and a receipt.
- Signing a copy of this Operating Agreement.

There is no "buy-in" required to become a Member.

The Founding Members will become Members upon execution of this agreement.

## 3.3 ACCEPTANCE OF MEMBERS

The Members shall decide by the modified consensus process described in Section 5.1 whether to accept an application for Membership. If an application is not accepted, the applicant’s employment shall be terminated immediately unless the Members, by the modified consensus process, choose to specify a Candidacy Period extension to be followed by a second decision by the Members on whether to accept the application. Upon acceptance of an application, the applicant shall immediately become a Member.

In the case of an application by a former Member, the Company may waive the Candidacy Period and accept back the former Member immediately by the affirmative vote of all the Members.

## 3.4 MEMBER RESIGNATION

A Member shall have the right to resign as a Member of the Company by filing a written notice of resignation with the Secretary of the Company. The resignation shall become effective immediately without any action on the part of the Company unless a future effective resignation date is specified in the written notice. An individual will not be allowed to work for the Company for one month following voluntary termination of Membership unless their Membership is reinstated by the Company. Resignation shall not relieve the resigning Member from any obligation for charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees, and this section shall not diminish any right of the Company to enforce any such obligation or obtain damages for its breach.

## 3.5 REMOVAL OF MEMBERS

No Member may be expelled or suspended, and no Membership or Memberships may be terminated or suspended, except according to procedures satisfying the requirements of this section.

A Member may, for any lawful reason, be expelled from the Company by a vote of sixty percent (60%) or greater of the Members at a duly called meeting at which a quorum minus one person is present.

If one or more Members wishes to propose the expulsion of a Member, all Members must be given notice of this intent at least 15 days prior to the member meeting at which the proposal will be considered. The notice will state the time and place of a hearing to occur not less than five days before the member meeting at which the proposal will be considered. The hearing may take place remotely via phone call or videoconference. The Member to be expelled will have the opportunity to be heard orally at that hearing and/or to submit written materials as they elect.

Any notice required under this section may be given by any method reasonably calculated to provide actual notice. Any notice given by mail must be given by first-class or registered mail sent to the last address of the Members shown on the Company’s records.

A Member who is expelled or suspended or whose Membership is terminated shall be liable for any charges incurred, dues, assessments, or fees incurred before expulsion, suspension, or termination or arising from contract or otherwise.

In rare circumstances in which it would not be reasonable to expect a Member to discuss their concerns with another Member, such as a case of alleged sexual harassment, a majority of Members of the Company may make such modifications to this process as are necessary to respect the rights of the alleged victim. Similarly, in cases of alleged extreme misconduct, a majority of Members of the Company may take measures to protect the rights of the Company and its clients, such as suspending the accused’s access to financial assets or authority to work on behalf of the Company, pending investigation. A majority of Members shall impose the terms and duration of suspension. The default shall be that suspension is without pay, but a consensus of Members excluding the suspended Member may provide otherwise.

# 4 NON-MEMBERS

From time to time the Members may hire external contractors as needed to conduct business. The hiring will be agreed upon through the normal process of decision-making described in Section 5.1.

- Being approved through the normal process of decision-making described in Section 5.1

# 5 VOTING AND MEETINGS

All consensus decisions are to be made at meetings as defined in this agreement.

## 5.2 SCOPE OF MEETINGS
